# world-happiness-report-analysis
This project aims to see the correlation between the score of 29 countries (top 10, bottom 10, BRICS) on the World Happiness Report and six self-selected parameters.

We have taken the World Happiness Report 2023 for reference and the data for the six parameters - Access to Electricity, GDP per Capita (PPP adjusted), Percentage of Total Population aged 0-14, Gross School Enrollment (Tertiary), Mean Annual Exposure to PM2.5 Air Pollution and CO2 Emissions - have been taken from the World Bank databank (the latest data has been taken for reference).
